This is a landmark update! openScale has been completely rewritten from the ground up to build a modern, stable, and faster foundation for the future.

- **Complete App Rewrite:** The entire app is now built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for better performance and a refreshed user interface.
- **New Bluetooth System:** A fully modernized Bluetooth stack improves connection reliability and makes it easier to support new scales.
- **Modern Architecture:** Updated to the latest standards for a more robust and future-proof app.

As this is a complete rewrite, you may encounter new bugs or regressions. Please report them via GitHub so we can fix them. Your patience and feedback are greatly appreciated!

A huge thank you to our beta testers!
